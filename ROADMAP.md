# Boiler Snake Roadmap

## Project Overview

Boiler Snake is a Discord bot for XP tracking, voice activities, YouTube notifications, role management, honeypots, scheduled-event reminders, staff notes, guild staff roles, user warnings, help tickets, and (planned) Twitch stream notifications. This roadmap documents **planned** features and their implementation stages.

**Shipped (see docs, not tracked here):** XP/leveling, voice XP, decay, level roles, reaction roles, YouTube notifications, command-channel restrictions, audit/message logs, honeypot channels & ban roles, scheduled event reminders, guild staff roles (`staff_roles` / `requireStaff`), staff notes, warnings, help tickets (MVP).

---

## 1. Help Ticket System

### Purpose

Ephemeral per-server ticket support: members open private channels with staff, staff respond, then **non-sensitive** tickets are closed and **archived** (AI summary + HTML transcript served by the bot). **Sensitive** tickets are never archived—content is destroyed with the channel.

### Status

**Shipped (MVP + panel)** — see [docs/tickets.md](docs/tickets.md). Design decisions locked in [1.10](#110-design-decisions-locked). Post-MVP remaining: Discord OAuth on transcripts; further attachment/panel polish.

---

### 1.1 Configuration

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/ticket setcategory <category>` | Category where ticket channels are created |
| `/ticket setarchive <channel>` | Channel that receives close-summary embeds + transcript links (staff-only channel recommended) |
| `/ticket setratelimit <minutes>` | Min minutes between self-created tickets per user (default **60** = 1/hour). `0` = disable |
| `/ticket settings` | Show current ticket configuration (incl. which guild **staff roles** apply) |

**Staff access** for ticket commands and open-ticket channel overwrites comes from the guild-wide [staff roles](#4-guild-staff-roles-admin-gate) list — **not** a ticket-only role. Configure with `/staff role add|remove|list`.

**Stored in `guild_settings`:**

| Column | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `ticket_category_id` | Parent category for open tickets |
| `ticket_archive_channel_id` | Staff-visible channel for archive posts |
| `ticket_rate_limit_minutes` | Cooldown for member self-create; default `60` |

**Panel:** `/ticket panel` posts a public embed + **Open a ticket** button (no DB row; delete the Discord message to remove).

---

### 1.2 Ticket Creation

| Command | Who | Description |
|---------|-----|-------------|
| `/ticket create [reason]` | Any member | Open a ticket for yourself (subject to rate limit) |
| `/ticket for <user> [reason]` | Staff | Pull a member into a **new** ticket (staff-initiated; **not** rate-limited like self-create) |

**Create UX:** slash `/ticket create` + staff `/ticket for`, plus admin `/ticket panel` → button → **modal** for description (same self-create pipeline and rate limit).

**On create:**

1. Enforce rate limit for **member self-create** only (`/ticket create` / future panel). Staff `/ticket for` bypasses member cooldown. **No cap** on concurrent open tickets per user.
2. Allocate next sequential `ticket_number` per guild.
3. Create channel `ticket-<NUMBER>` under the configured category (if set).
4. Apply permission overwrites (see [1.3](#13-permissions--sensitive-tickets)).
5. Persist row in `tickets` (`status = open`, `is_sensitive = 0`).
6. Post welcome embed in the ticket (reason, creator, ticket #).
7. If `/ticket for`: DM the target member with a channel link (if DMs open); post a note in-channel (“Opened for @user by @staff”).

**Rate limit default:** 1 ticket per **60 minutes** per user per guild for self-create. Configurable via `/ticket setratelimit`. Based on `tickets.created_at` of that user’s last created ticket (any status), or last self-create only—prefer last **self-created** ticket timestamp.

---

### 1.3 Permissions & Sensitive Tickets

#### Default (non-sensitive) open ticket

| Subject | Access |
|---------|--------|
| `@everyone` | Deny `ViewChannel` |
| Ticket **members** (creator + users added via `/ticket adduser`) | Allow view, send, attach, history; deny manage messages |
| **Each guild staff role** (from `staff_roles` / generalized honeypot exempt list) | Full staff access (view, send, manage messages, etc.) |
| Bot | Full channel management |

Any member with a configured staff role (or ManageGuild for commands) can help. If **no** staff roles are configured, only ManageGuild holders pass the command gate; channel overwrites still need at least one staff role for non-admin staff to see tickets—admins should run `/staff role add` first.

#### Sensitive ticket

Locks visibility to:

- **Staff owner** (claimer / transfer target)
- **Additional named staff** added via `/ticket addstaff` (user overwrites only—not the whole staff role)
- **Member users** of the ticket (creator + `/ticket adduser`)
- **Bot**

Everyone else, including other staff-role members, **cannot** view the channel.

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/ticket claim` | Become staff owner (sets `staff_owner_id`; always allowed on open tickets) |
| `/ticket transfer <staff>` | Reassign staff owner; update overwrites if sensitive |
| `/ticket addstaff <user>` | Allow-list another staff user on this ticket (especially useful when sensitive) |
| `/ticket removestaff <user>` | Remove a named staff allow-list entry (cannot remove last owner without transfer) |
| `/ticket sensitive` | Mark sensitive and **rewrite overwrites**. Requires a staff owner: if none, **auto-claim** the invoker; if invoker is not owner and owner exists, only owner (or ManageGuild—see below) may flip |
| `/ticket unsensitive` | Restore default staff-role visibility. **Staff owner** or **staff gate** (ManageGuild / staff role) only |

**Overwrite strategy when sensitive:**

1. Keep `@everyone` deny view.
2. **Remove allow / explicitly deny** every guild staff role on this channel.
3. Allow only: each ticket member user + staff owner + each `/ticket addstaff` user + bot.
4. Set `is_sensitive = 1` on the ticket row.

**Ownership model (locked):**

- Prefer `/ticket claim` before sensitive work; `/ticket sensitive` **auto-claims** the invoker if `staff_owner_id` is null.
- Multiple staff: `/ticket addstaff` adds named users without restoring the staff role.
- `/ticket transfer` moves ownership and updates overwrites.

---

### 1.4 Staff & Lifecycle Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/ticket close [reason]` | Close ticket (archive only if **not** sensitive—see [1.5](#15-close--archive-pipeline)) |
| `/ticket adduser <user>` | Add a member participant |
| `/ticket removeuser <user>` | Remove a member participant (creator removal: staff only; optional block) |
| `/ticket claim` | Set yourself as staff owner |
| `/ticket transfer <staff>` | Reassign staff owner |
| `/ticket addstaff` / `/ticket removestaff` | Named staff allow-list |
| `/ticket sensitive` / `/ticket unsensitive` | Toggle lock-down |
| `/ticket list [user]` | Active tickets (staff) |
| `/ticket info` | Ticket #, status, sensitive, owner, members (in-channel) |
| `/ticket for <user> [reason]` | Staff: open ticket for a member |

---

### 1.5 Close → Archive Pipeline

Staff only, in a ticket channel.

#### Branch A — Sensitive ticket (**no content archive**; metadata stub required)

Sensitive tickets **must not** be content-archived. On `/ticket close`:

```
1. Update DB  — status=closed, closed_at, closed_by, close_reason; is_sensitive remains 1; archived=0
2. No fetch   — do not paginate or store messages
3. No HTML    — do not write transcript files
4. No AI      — do not send content to any LLM
5. No URL     — transcript_token / path stay null
6. Stub post  — required: post a minimal, non-content embed in the archive channel, e.g.
              “Ticket #42 closed (sensitive — not archived)” with closer, requester,
              timestamps, and close reason only. No transcript link, no message excerpts.
7. Delete     — delete the live Discord channel
8. Optional DM to requester — “Your ticket was closed” only; never include a transcript link
```

Rationale: privacy. Channel deletion is the disposal mechanism; DB + archive stub retain metadata only (who/when/sensitive flag), not conversation content.

#### Branch B — Non-sensitive ticket (full archive)

```
1. Freeze   — optional: deny send while archiving
2. Fetch    — paginate all channel messages (oldest → newest)
3. Persist  — store structured messages in ticket_messages (+ ticket meta)
4. Render   — generate HTML transcript on disk
5. Summarize— AI structured summary (or stats fallback if no AI key)
6. Publish  — post embed to ticket_archive_channel with summary + transcript URL
              (staff channel only; never DM transcript URL to members)
7. Delete   — delete the live Discord channel
8. Notify   — optional DM to requester: closed + reason only, **no** transcript URL
```

#### HTML transcript (bot-served)

- **Render:** standalone HTML — ticket meta, participants, chronological messages, **hotlinked** attachment URLs, timestamps.
- **Store:** `{DATA_DIR}/ticket-transcripts/{guild_id}/{uuid}.html` (UUID matches public token).
- **Serve:** small HTTP server in the bot process:
  - Path: `/t/{uuid}` (UUID v4)
  - Config: `TICKET_HTTP_PORT`, `TICKET_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` (public origin for embeds; reverse-proxy TLS documented for operators)
- **Access control (MVP):**
  - UUID in the path (unguessable).
  - Link posted **only** in the configured **staff** archive channel.
  - Members / requesters **never** receive the transcript URL.
  - **Later:** “Login with Discord” gate so only staff can load `/t/{uuid}` even with the link.
- **Attachments (MVP):** hotlink Discord CDN URLs in the HTML.  
  **TODO (post-MVP):** at close time, download all thread assets into  
  `{DATA_DIR}/ticket-transcripts/{guild_id}/{uuid}/assets/` and rewrite HTML to local paths (CDN links expire).

#### AI-generated structured summary

Only for **non-sensitive** closes. Posted as embed fields in the archive channel (plus transcript link).

| Field | Example |
|-------|---------|
| Ticket # | `#42` |
| Subject / reason | Open reason |
| Requester | `@user` |
| Staff owner | `@mod` |
| Opened / closed | timestamps + duration |
| Message count | N |
| Close reason | Staff-provided |
| Resolution | AI one-liner (or close reason if no AI) |
| Summary | AI multi-sentence narrative |
| Transcript | `[View HTML transcript](https://…/t/{uuid})` — staff archive only |

**Provider:** env-based OpenAI-compatible API (e.g. SpaceXAI). If no API key: non-AI fallback (stats + close reason + short excerpt). Sensitive path never calls the provider.

```bash
# Ticket transcript HTTP
TICKET_HTTP_PORT=8080
TICKET_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://tickets.example.com

# Optional AI summarization (non-sensitive archives only)
AI_API_KEY=
AI_BASE_URL=
AI_MODEL=
```

Docker: publish transcript port; persist `{DATA_DIR}/ticket-transcripts` on the existing data volume.

#### Archive channel message (non-sensitive)

- Channel: `ticket_archive_channel_id` (must be staff-only in Discord permissions—bot cannot enforce “staff eyes only” on Discord itself beyond recommending this).
- Embed: structured summary + transcript URL.
- On partial failure: still prefer HTML on disk + DB close row; post “summary unavailable” if AI fails; alert closer if archive channel missing.

#### Archive channel message (sensitive — required stub)

- Same channel, **metadata only**, clearly labeled **not archived** / **sensitive**.
- No link, no content, no AI.
- If archive channel is unset, still close + delete; warn the closer that the stub could not be posted.

---

### 1.7 db.js API (sketch)

- `getTicketSettings(guildId)` / `updateTicketSettings(guildId, patch)`
- `canUserCreateTicket(guildId, userId)` → rate-limit check using `ticket_rate_limit_minutes`
- `createTicket({ guildId, creatorUserId, channelId, reason, openedByStaffId? })`
- `getTicketByChannel` / `getTicketByNumber` / `getTicketByTranscriptToken(uuid)`
- `claimTicket` / `transferTicket` / `addTicketStaff` / `removeTicketStaff`
- `setTicketSensitive` / `setTicketUnsensitive`
- `addTicketMember` / `removeTicketMember` / `listTicketMembers`
- `listOpenTickets(guildId, { userId? })`
- `closeTicketSensitive(ticketId, { closedBy, closeReason })` — metadata only, `archived=0`
- `closeTicketArchived(ticketId, { closedBy, closeReason, transcriptToken, transcriptPath, aiSummaryJson, archiveMessageId })` — `archived=1`
- `saveTicketMessages(ticketId, messages[])`

---

### 1.8 Event Handlers

| Event | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| Slash + panel button/modal | Create, for, close, sensitive, claim, adduser, addstaff; panel open → modal |
| `ChannelDelete` | If ticket channel deleted outside `/ticket close`: mark `closed`, `archived=0`, no salvage for sensitive intent; non-sensitive best-effort only if we still have cache (usually not) |

Channel create is **bot-driven**.

---

### 1.9 Implementation Order

1. **Schema + settings** — migrations; setcategory / setarchive / setratelimit / settings (depends on [staff roles](#4-guild-staff-roles-admin-gate) for gate + overwrites)  
2. **Create paths** — `/ticket create`, `/ticket for`, overwrites for **all** staff roles, rate limit  
3. **Claim / adduser / addstaff / sensitive** — overwrite rewrite (deny all staff roles when sensitive)  
4. **Close (sensitive branch)** — metadata + required archive-channel stub + delete channel  
5. **Close (archive branch)** — fetch, HTML, UUID route HTTP server, archive embed (stats fallback)  
6. **AI summary** — non-sensitive only; graceful fallback  
7. **Post-MVP** — Discord OAuth on `/t/{uuid}`; panel registry list/edit; further attachment polish (local mirror is already implemented)  

---

### 1.10 Design decisions (locked)

| # | Decision |
|---|----------|
| 1 | **Ownership:** claim / auto-claim on sensitive; `/ticket transfer`; `/ticket addstaff` for extra named staff without restoring staff role |
| 2 | **Sensitive tickets are never content-archived** — no message fetch, no HTML, no AI, no transcript URL; channel delete is disposal; **required** metadata-only archive stub |
| 3 | **Transcript URL is staff-only** — posted only to the ticket archive channel; never DMed to members/requesters |
| 4 | **MVP URL security:** UUID path `/t/{uuid}`; **later:** Login with Discord for real access control |
| 5 | **Attachments MVP:** hotlink Discord CDN URLs; **TODO:** download all thread assets at archive time and serve locally |
| 6 | **Create UX:** slash `/ticket create` + staff `/ticket for @user` + **panel button → modal** for description (same pipeline) |
| 7 | **Rate limit:** configurable per guild; **default 60 minutes** (1 self-create per hour); staff `/ticket for` not subject to member cooldown |
| 8 | **No concurrent open-ticket cap** per user — rate limit only throttles new self-creates |
| 9 | **Sensitive close stub required** in the archive channel (metadata only; no transcript) |
| 10 | **`/ticket unsensitive`:** staff **owner** or anyone passing the [staff/admin gate](#4-guild-staff-roles-admin-gate) |
| 11 | **No ticket-only staff role** — use guild `staff_roles` (generalized `honeypot_exempt_roles`) for commands + channel overwrites |

---

## 2. Scheduled Event Reminders

### Purpose

Send configurable pre-event reminder pings for Discord’s built-in **Guild Scheduled Events**. Only users who marked **Interested** on the event are notified (via a per-event role). Anyone can **opt out** of reminder pings globally (per guild).

### Status

**Shipped** — implemented in `src/features/eventReminders/` (see [docs/event-reminders.md](docs/event-reminders.md)). Design decisions in [2.11](#211-design-decisions-locked) remain the product contract.

---

### 2.1 Core behavior

```
Authorized user links reminders to a Discord scheduled event
        → bot creates role event-<shortname>
        → syncs role to current “Interested” users (minus opt-outs)
        → keeps role in sync on interest add/remove
        → at each configured offset before start, posts ONE message mentioning @event-<shortname>
        → when event completes/cancels (or manual clear): delete role + deactivate config
          (cleanup prevents shortname/role collisions for future events)
```

| Rule | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Audience | Only members who are **Interested** on that scheduled event |
| Opt-out | **Guild-wide** per user (`/optout`) **or** per-event mute (`/mute`); both skip role grant and thus pings. Guild opt-out always wins |
| Ping mechanism | Mention dedicated role `event-<shortname>` (not mass user mentions) |
| Timing | Relative offsets before the event’s scheduled start (e.g. 1d, 1h, 15m) |
| Delivery | **One Discord message per offset**: role ping in content + **embed** details (not a digest) |
| Create UX | Slash picks the event → **modal** configures shortname (slug + collision suffix), offsets, channel, embed description |
| Who may configure | **ManageGuild** **or** the Discord scheduled event’s **creator** |
| Role lifecycle | Create on setup; **delete after event is done** (completed/canceled) or on `/clear` |

---

### 2.2 Commands

#### Staff / event creator

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/eventreminder create` | Pick a scheduled event (autocomplete) → **opens modal** to configure reminders |
| `/eventreminder edit` | Re-open config for an existing linked event (modal; see component notes) |
| `/eventreminder list` | List active configs (offsets, channel, role, next fire) |
| `/eventreminder clear <event>` | Stop reminders, delete `event-*` role, remove/deactivate DB rows |
| `/eventreminder sync <event>` | Re-fetch interested users and reconcile role membership |
| `/eventreminder setchannel [channel]` | Default guild channel for reminder posts (overridable per config in modal) |

**Permission gate:** invoker has `ManageGuild` **or** `invoker.id === scheduledEvent.creatorId` (event creator). Edit/clear/sync for a given event: same rule (ManageGuild or that event’s creator). `setchannel` is guild-wide → **ManageGuild only**.

#### Everyone

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/eventreminder optout` | Opt out of **all** event reminder roles/pings in this guild |
| `/eventreminder optin` | Re-enable reminders; re-sync roles for events you are still Interested in (skips muted) |
| `/eventreminder mute` | Mute one linked event (strip that role; block future grants) |
| `/eventreminder unmute` | Clear mute; re-grant if still Interested and not guild-opted-out |
| `/eventreminder status` | Show guild opt-out, muted events, and event roles you currently hold |

Ephemeral replies for opt-out/opt-in/mute/unmute/status.

---

### 2.3 Create flow (modal) & Discord UI limits

#### What Discord modals can and cannot do

| Control | In modals today? | Notes |
|---------|------------------|--------|
| **Date / time picker** | **No** | Not available on modal forms (still a requested platform feature). |
| **Text input** | Yes | Short or paragraph. |
| **String select (dropdown)** | Yes | Up to 25 options; multi-select supported. Ideal for preset offsets. |
| **Channel / user / role select** | Yes | Good for notify-channel override. |
| **Labels / text display** | Yes | Help text inside the modal. |

We do **not** need absolute date/time pickers for MVP: reminders are **offsets relative to the event’s existing start time** (Discord already owns the event schedule). Absolute “remind at 3:00 PM” would be a later enhancement and would use a **text field** (parse ISO / human time) or a multi-step message UI—not a native date picker.

#### Recommended modal layout (MVP)

1. User runs `/eventreminder create event:<scheduled event>` (ManageGuild **or** event creator).
2. Bot validates: event exists, scheduled (not completed/canceled), not already configured (else point to `edit`).
3. Bot shows modal `Reminders: {event name}`:

| Component | Purpose | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| **Text** `shortname` | Role suffix; prefilled with slug of event title | `raid-friday` → `event-raid-friday` |
| **String select** `offsets` (multi) | Preset times before start | `1 week`, `1 day`, `1 hour`, `30 min`, `15 min`, `5 min` — **default selection:** `1 day`, `1 hour`, `15 min` |
| **Text** `offsets_custom` (optional) | Extra freeform offsets | `2h, 10m` grammar `(\d+)(m\|h\|d)` |
| **Channel select** `channel` (optional) | Notify channel override | empty / unset → guild default |
| **Text** `message` (optional) | Custom body; placeholders `{event}`, `{location}`, `{starts_in}`, `{role}` | default template if empty |

4. On submit:
   - Union selected presets + parsed custom offsets; dedupe; reject empty set; cap count (e.g. 8) and max lookback (e.g. 30d).
   - Compute `fire_at = eventStart - offset` for each; drop offsets that are already in the past (or warn and skip).
   - Create role `event-<shortname>` (`mentionable: false` preferred; bot still pings by ID). Hoist off.
   - Persist config + one **offset row** per fire (each gets its **own message** when due).
   - Fetch interested users, skip guild opt-outs, assign role.
   - Ephemeral confirm: role, offsets, channel, computed fire times.

**Shortname rules:** lowercase `[a-z0-9-]`; unique among **active** configs in the guild. After event cleanup deletes the role and frees the shortname.

**Collision fallback:** if an orphaned `event-*` role still exists (manual rename, failed cleanup), delete/reuse only roles the bot created and tracked in DB; otherwise error with “role name in use—clear or pick another shortname.”

---

### 2.4 Who gets pinged

1. User marks **Interested** → `GuildScheduledEventUserAdd` → if config active and not guild-opted-out and not muted for this event → grant `event-*` role.
2. User removes interest → remove role.
3. `/eventreminder optout` → guild opt-out flag; **strip all bot-managed event reminder roles** for that guild; future sync skips them.
4. `/eventreminder optin` → clear flag; re-grant for events they are still Interested in (skips muted).
5. `/eventreminder mute` → per-event mute row; strip that event’s role; future sync skips that event.
6. `/eventreminder unmute` → clear mute; re-grant if still Interested and not guild-opted-out.

Pings are `@event-<shortname>` in message **content** plus an embed in the notify channel. Only role holders are notified. Opted-out or muted users never hold the role.

---

### 2.5 Delivery ticker & cleanup

- Background **node-cron** every **60s** (`* * * * *`; shipped).
- Query pending rows: `fire_at <= now` and `sent_at IS NULL`.
- For each due offset (**one message per offset**):
  1. Resolve channel, role, event; skip if missing/canceled.
  2. Post message (template or default with `<t:unix:R>` / `<t:unix:F>` + role mention).
  3. Set `sent_at` + `message_id`.
- **Post-event cleanup (required):** when the scheduled event is **completed** or **canceled** (gateway update/delete), or after start + all offsets handled as a safety net:
  1. Delete the Discord role `event-<shortname>`.
  2. Mark config `active = 0` (or delete rows).
  3. Free shortname for future events → **prevents role collisions**.
- Manual `/eventreminder clear` runs the same role deletion path.

**Reschedule:** if event start time changes, recompute all **unsent** `fire_at` from new start − offsets.

---

### 2.6 Guild settings & permissions

| Setting | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `event_reminder_channel_id` | Default notify channel |

**Configure reminders:** `ManageGuild` **or** scheduled event **creator** (`creatorId`).  
**Set default channel:** `ManageGuild` only.

**Bot needs:** Manage Roles (create/assign/delete; bot role above `event-*`), Send Messages + permission to mention roles in notify channel, scheduled-event subscriber API access.

Gateway: `GuildScheduledEventUserAdd` / `Remove` / `Update` / `Delete`.

---

    id             INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    config_id      INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES event_reminder_configs(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    offset_minutes INTEGER NOT NULL,              -- minutes before start
    fire_at        INTEGER NOT NULL,              -- ms epoch absolute
    sent_at        INTEGER,                       -- null until that offset's message is posted
    message_id     TEXT                           -- that offset's reminder message
);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_event_reminder_due
  ON event_reminder_offsets(fire_at) WHERE sent_at IS NULL;

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS event_reminder_optouts (
    guild_id     TEXT NOT NULL,
    user_id      TEXT NOT NULL,
    opted_out_at INTEGER NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (guild_id, user_id)
);
```

Note: `UNIQUE (guild_id, shortname)` applies to all rows; if we soft-deactivate with `active=0`, either delete inactive configs on cleanup or use a partial unique index / include only active rows in uniqueness logic (prefer **delete role + delete or rename shortname on cleanup** so the unique constraint stays simple).

---

### 2.8 db.js / module API (sketch)

- `getEventReminderSettings(guildId)` / default channel helpers
- `createEventReminderConfig({ guildId, eventId, shortname, roleId, channelId, template, offsets[], createdBy })`
- `listEventReminderConfigs(guildId)`
- `clearEventReminderConfig(guildId, eventId)` → returns `role_id` for deletion
- `setOffsetFireTimes(configId, eventStartMs)` — recompute unsent fires
- `claimDueReminders(now, limit)` — due unsent offsets
- `markReminderSent(offsetId, messageId)`
- `isEventReminderOptedOut` / `setEventReminderOptOut` / `clearEventReminderOptOut`
- `getConfigByScheduledEventId(guildId, eventId)`
- `canConfigureEventReminder(member, scheduledEvent)` → ManageGuild or creator

Implementation module: `src/eventReminders.js` (ticker + role sync + delivery + cleanup).

---

### 2.9 Event handlers

| Event / trigger | Action |
|-----------------|--------|
| Modal submit (create / edit) | Role + config + offsets + initial subscriber sync |
| `guildScheduledEventUserAdd` | Grant role if active and not opted out |
| `guildScheduledEventUserRemove` | Remove role |
| `guildScheduledEventUpdate` | Start time change → recompute unsent `fire_at`; completed/canceled → **cleanup role + config** |
| `guildScheduledEventDelete` | **Cleanup role + config** |
| Interval ticker | Deliver due offsets (**one message each**); safety cleanup after event end |
| `/eventreminder optout` / `optin` / `mute` / `unmute` | Toggle guild opt-out or per-event mute + strip or re-sync roles |

---

### 2.10 Implementation order

1. Schema + opt-out / opt-in / status  
2. Create + modal (presets select + custom text + channel select) + permission gate (ManageGuild \| creator)  
3. Role create + subscriber sync  
4. Gateway interest add/remove  
5. Ticker + **one message per offset**  
6. **Post-event role cleanup** (update/delete + clear command)  
7. Edit / list / sync / setchannel polish  

---

### 2.11 Design decisions (locked)

| # | Decision |
|---|----------|
| 1 | **Modal UI:** no native date/time pickers on Discord modals. Use **relative offsets** (string **multi-select presets** + optional custom text). Channel override via **channel select**. Absolute datetimes not required for MVP. |
| 2 | **One message per offset** (not a digest). |
| 3 | **Permission:** `ManageGuild` **or** the scheduled event’s **creator**. Guild default channel: ManageGuild only. |
| 4 | **Role cleanup after event completes/cancels** (and on clear) — primary defense against shortname/role collisions. |
| 5 | **Opt-out:** guild-wide `/optout` **and** per-event `/mute`; guild opt-out always wins for grants. |
| 6 | **Default preset selection** in modal: `1 day`, `1 hour`, `15 min` (user can change). |
| 7 | **Delivery:** always embed + role mention in message content (embed mentions do not notify). |
| 8 | **Shortname suggest:** slug of event title; append `-2`…`-99` on collision among existing configs. |

**Still minor (non-blocking):**

- Role `mentionable: false` vs true (recommend **false**; bot mentions by snowflake).
- Exact preset list beyond the defaults above.

---

## 3. Twitch Stream Notifications

### Purpose

Notify a guild when any subscribed Twitch channel goes live. Supports **any number of channels** per guild, posts to a configurable Discord channel, and optionally **pings a guild-configurable role** that is **independent of YouTube** notification roles (`youtube_upload_role_id` and any future YouTube live role).

### Status

**Planned** — design decisions locked (see [3.8](#38-design-decisions-locked)); ready to implement once scheduled. Patterned after the shipped YouTube feature (`src/features/youtube/`).

---

### 3.1 Core behavior

```
Admin adds one or more Twitch logins
        → bot resolves login → broadcaster user id (Helix)
        → ticker polls Helix streams for subscribed broadcasters
        → on transition offline → live: post embed to notify channel
        → if twitch_notify_role_id set: mention that role on the message
        → record last_stream_id / is_live so the same stream is not re-announced
```

| Rule | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Scope | **Go-live only** (MVP). No go-offline, no VODs, no follows/clips |
| Channels | **Any number** of Twitch channels per guild (same broadcaster may be tracked in multiple guilds) |
| Notify channel | Per-guild `twitch_notification_channel_id` — **separate** from YouTube’s channel |
| Role ping | Optional per-guild `twitch_notify_role_id` — **separate** from `youtube_upload_role_id` |
| No role | If role unset, post embed with no role mention (do **not** fall back to YouTube role or `@everyone`) |
| Dedup | Track `last_stream_id` (and/or `is_live`) per subscription; notify only on offline→live transition for a new stream id |
| Auth | Helix app access token via Client Credentials (`TWITCH_CLIENT_ID` + `TWITCH_CLIENT_SECRET`) |
| Permission | Config / subscribe commands: **ManageGuild** (same as YouTube) |

---

### 3.2 Commands

#### Channel subscriptions

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/twitch add login:<name\|url>` | Subscribe to a Twitch channel (login, `https://twitch.tv/…`, or bare username) |
| `/twitch remove channel:<…>` | Unsubscribe (autocomplete over guild subscriptions) |
| `/twitch list` | List subscribed channels + notify channel / role status |

#### Guild configuration

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/settwitch channel <channel>` | Discord channel for go-live posts |
| `/settwitch role [role]` | Role to mention on go-live (omit or clear to disable pings) |
| `/settwitch interval <minutes>` | Polling interval 1–60 (default **2** — streams are more time-sensitive than YT uploads) |
| `/settwitch settings` | Show current channel, role, interval, and subscription count |

**Optional (nice-to-have in same PR or follow-up):** `/testtwitchnotification` mirroring `/testnotification` for YouTube.

**Not in MVP:** per-channel Discord channel override, per-channel role override, custom message templates.

---

### 3.3 Notification content

On go-live, post to the configured Discord channel:

- **Content line:** optional `<@&roleId> ` prefix when `twitch_notify_role_id` is set
- **Embed** (purple/Twitch brand, e.g. `#9146FF`):
  - Title / name: `{display_name} is live!`
  - Description: stream title
  - URL: `https://twitch.tv/{login}`
  - Thumbnail or preview image when Helix provides one
  - Footer / fields: game/category name if available

One Discord message per newly detected live stream (not a digest of multiple channels in one message).

**Allowed mentions:** when posting, set `allowedMentions: { roles: [roleId] }` so only the configured Twitch role is pinged.

---

### 3.4 Polling ticker (MVP)

Module layout (mirror YouTube):

| Path | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| `src/features/twitch/index.js` | Slash commands, handlers, registration export |
| `src/features/twitch/ticker.js` | Helix auth + stream poll loop + send notification |

**Ticker loop:**

1. Load all guilds with ≥1 `twitch_channels` row and a set `twitch_notification_channel_id`.
2. Batch Helix `GET /helix/streams?user_id=` (up to Helix’s multi-id limit per request) across unique broadcaster ids.
3. For each subscription:
   - If stream present and `stream.id !== last_stream_id` (or was not live): send notification; set `is_live=1`, `last_stream_id`, `last_checked`.
   - If stream absent and was live: set `is_live=0`, update `last_checked` (no Discord message).
4. Honor per-guild `twitch_polling_interval_minutes` (or a single process interval = min of configured guilds, then gate per guild by last run—same practical approach as YouTube is fine).

**Startup:** skip ticker if `TWITCH_CLIENT_ID` / `TWITCH_CLIENT_SECRET` missing; log once (same pattern as YouTube without `YOUTUBE_API_KEY`).

**Env vars:**

```bash
TWITCH_CLIENT_ID=...
TWITCH_CLIENT_SECRET=...
```

App registration: [Twitch Developer Console](https://dev.twitch.tv/console) → application → Client Credentials grant (no user OAuth for MVP).

---

### 3.5 Database schema (working draft)

**`guild_settings` columns:**

| Column | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `twitch_notification_channel_id` | Discord channel for go-live posts |
| `twitch_notify_role_id` | Optional role to mention (null = no ping) |
| `twitch_polling_interval_minutes` | Default **2**; clamp 1–60 |

**`twitch_channels` table:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS twitch_channels (
  guild_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  broadcaster_id TEXT NOT NULL,     -- Twitch user id (stable)
  login TEXT NOT NULL,              -- lowercase login
  display_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  profile_image_url TEXT,
  is_live INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  last_stream_id TEXT,             -- Helix stream id; dedup go-live
  last_checked INTEGER,
  created_at INTEGER NOT NULL,
  updated_at INTEGER NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (guild_id, broadcaster_id),
  UNIQUE (guild_id, login)
);
```

**Repositories / db facade (sketch):**

- `getTwitchChannels(guildId)` / `addTwitchChannel(...)` / `removeTwitchChannel(guildId, broadcasterId)`
- `updateTwitchChannelLiveState(guildId, broadcasterId, { isLive, lastStreamId, lastChecked })`
- `listAllTwitchSubscriptions()` for the ticker
- `updateGuildSettings` keys for the three `twitch_*` settings

---

### 3.6 Integration points

| Area | Change |
|------|--------|
| `src/features/twitch/` | New feature module (commands + ticker) |
| `src/commands/` registry | Register `/twitch`, `/settwitch`, autocomplete for remove |
| `src/index.js` / client startup | Start Twitch ticker beside YouTube ticker |
| `src/db/` | Migration for columns + table; repository + facade exports |
| Docs | `docs/twitch-notifications.md` (mirror `docs/youtube-notifications.md`) |
| `.env.example` | `TWITCH_CLIENT_ID`, `TWITCH_CLIENT_SECRET` |
| Audit log | Config changes for channel / role / interval (same style as YouTube) |

**Bot permissions:** Send Messages + Embed Links in the notify channel; ability to mention the configured role (role must be mentionable **or** bot uses role id mention with `allowedMentions` — prefer id mention without requiring the role to be open-mentionable).

---

### 3.7 Implementation order

1. Migration + repository + guild_settings defaults  
2. Helix app-token helper + user/login resolve + streams lookup  
3. `/twitch add|remove|list`  
4. `/settwitch channel|role|interval|settings`  
5. Ticker + go-live embed + role mention  
6. Wire startup + register commands  
7. Docs + `.env.example`  
8. Tests: repo CRUD, dedup transition offline→live, no notify when still live with same `stream.id`

---

### 3.8 Design decisions (locked)

| # | Decision |
|---|----------|
| 1 | **Multi-channel:** any number of Twitch subscriptions per guild; no hard cap in MVP (monitor Helix rate limits). |
| 2 | **Role is guild-wide and Twitch-only:** `twitch_notify_role_id` never shares storage or fallback with YouTube roles. |
| 3 | **Optional ping:** null role ⇒ silent embed (no `@everyone` fallback). |
| 4 | **Go-live only** for MVP; offline cleanup is DB state only. |
| 5 | **Polling Helix** for MVP (matches existing YouTube ticker ops model). EventSub webhooks = post-MVP if we want lower latency / less quota. |
| 6 | **Dedup by stream id** on offline→live; re-notify only for a new stream session. |
| 7 | **Separate notify channel** from YouTube (`twitch_notification_channel_id`). |
| 8 | **Admin gate:** guild [staff roles](#4-guild-staff-roles-admin-gate) (`requireStaff`) for all Twitch config/subscribe commands (ManageGuild or staff role once §4 ships; ManageGuild-only until then). |

**Still open (non-blocking):**

- Exact default polling interval (recommend **2** minutes).
- Whether to include game/category and viewer count on the embed (recommend **yes** for title + game; viewer count optional).
- Test command in MVP vs follow-up.

---

## 4. Guild Staff Roles (Admin Gate)

### Purpose

One guild-scoped **multi-role allow-list** that powers the bot’s **admin/staff gate** for every feature that today checks `ManageGuild` (config, honeypot ops, logs, YouTube, tickets, notes, warnings, …).

Built by **generalizing the existing honeypot exempt-role store** (`honeypot_exempt_roles`) — same shape, same “these roles are trusted staff” meaning, expanded purpose. No parallel per-feature staff lists.

### Status

**Shipped** — implemented in `src/features/staffRoles/` with migration `008_staff_roles` and `isStaff` / `requireStaff` in `src/core/permissions.js`. Design decisions in [4.8](#48-design-decisions-locked) remain the product contract.

---

### 4.1 Existing data structure (reuse)

Shipped today for honeypot exemption:

```sql
-- src/db/migrations/001_base_schema.js (current name)
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS honeypot_exempt_roles (
  guild_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  role_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at INTEGER NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (guild_id, role_id)
);
```

API already in `src/db/repositories/honeypot.js`:

| Function | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| `addHoneypotExemptRole(guildId, roleId)` | `INSERT OR IGNORE` |
| `removeHoneypotExemptRole` | Delete row |
| `listHoneypotExemptRoles` | Ordered by `created_at` |
| `memberHasHoneypotExemptRole(guildId, memberRoleIds)` | True if **any** member role is listed |

**MVP migration:** rename table → `staff_roles` (data preserved). Keep thin honeypot wrappers or re-export under staff names so honeypot exemption **is** “member has a staff role” — one source of truth.

Optional columns later (not required for rename): `added_by TEXT` — skip for MVP to avoid rewriting every row; `created_at` already records when the role was trusted.

---

### 4.2 Permission model (admin gate)

Replace the narrow check in `src/core/permissions.js`:

```
// Today
isAdminOrMod(interaction) ⇔ member has ManageGuild

// Target
isStaff(interaction) ⇔
    member has ManageGuild
    OR member holds any role in staff_roles for this guild
```

| Helper | Use |
|--------|-----|
| `isStaff(interaction \| member, guildId)` | Gate for staff/config commands (successor to `isAdminOrMod`) |
| `requireStaff(interaction)` | Ephemeral deny if not staff (successor to `requireAdmin`) |
| `listStaffRoles(guildId)` / `addStaffRole` / `removeStaffRole` | CRUD on `staff_roles` |
| `memberHasStaffRole(guildId, roleIds)` | Pure DB check (honeypot + tickets) |

**Who may edit the staff role list:** **`ManageGuild` only** (true Discord admins). Staff-role holders get feature access but **cannot** grant or revoke staff roles (no privilege escalation).

**Empty `staff_roles`:** only ManageGuild passes the gate — same practical default as today for command access. Honeypot still has **no** automatic ManageGuild exemption (unchanged product rule): only listed roles skip honeypot bans; admins without a listed role can still be banned if they trip a honeypot. Document clearly.

**Two related but distinct rules:**

| Context | Rule |
|---------|------|
| **Slash / bot admin gate** | ManageGuild **or** staff role |
| **Honeypot ban exemption** | Staff role only (not bare ManageGuild) — preserves current honeypot safety |

---

### 4.3 Commands

| Command | Who | Description |
|---------|-----|-------------|
| `/staff role add role:<role>` | ManageGuild | Trust this role as staff (insert into `staff_roles`) |
| `/staff role remove role:<role>` | ManageGuild | Remove from staff list |
| `/staff role list` | Staff gate | List trusted staff roles |
| `/staff settings` | Staff gate | Show staff roles + short “used by: admin gate, honeypot exempt, tickets, …” |

**Honeypot UX compatibility:**

| Approach | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| **Preferred** | `/honeypot exempt add\|list\|del` become **aliases** of staff role CRUD (same table). Help text: “Guild staff roles — also used for honeypot exemption.” |
| **Or** | Deprecate exempt subcommands after `/staff` ships; migrate docs only. |

Do **not** keep two tables.

---

### 4.4 Discord slash visibility

Today many commands set `setDefaultMemberPermissions(ManageGuild)`, which **hides** them from non-admins in the Discord UI even if the bot would allow staff roles in code.

**MVP approach (pick one; recommend A):**

| Option | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| **A (recommended)** | Clear or lower `defaultMemberPermissions` on staff-gated commands; **always** enforce `requireStaff` in handlers. Server Integration overrides remain available. |
| **B** | Keep Discord-level ManageGuild default; document that guild owners must grant command access to staff roles under **Server Settings → Integrations → Boiler Snake**. |

Option A matches “staff roles are first-class admin gate.” Public commands (`/xp`, `/leaderboard`, `/warn mine`) stay unrestricted.

---

### 4.5 What uses the gate

| Area | How staff roles apply |
|------|------------------------|
| **Core permissions** | `isStaff` / `requireStaff` for all current `isAdminOrMod` call sites |
| **Honeypot** | Exempt list **is** `staff_roles` (rename + same semantics) |
| **Tickets** | Command gate + **channel overwrites** for every staff role on open tickets |
| **Staff notes** | Ops gate via `requireStaff` — no note-specific role table |
| **Warnings** | Staff ops via `requireStaff` — no warn-specific role table |
| **Settings, logs, YouTube, Twitch, reaction roles, decay config, …** | Same staff gate as today but staff-role aware |
| **Event reminders** | Keep **ManageGuild or event creator** for create/edit (creator exception stays); guild default channel may stay ManageGuild-only **or** staff — prefer **staff gate** for consistency unless product wants stricter |

**Not gated by staff roles:** public XP/leaderboard; member `/warn mine`; ticket self-create; eventreminder opt-out/in.

---

### 4.6 Module layout

| Path | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| `src/db/repositories/staffRoles.js` | CRUD + `memberHasStaffRole` (migrated from honeypot exempt helpers) |
| `src/core/permissions.js` | `isStaff`, `requireStaff`; deprecate/alias `isAdminOrMod` → `isStaff` |
| `src/features/staff/` (or `staffRoles/`) | `/staff` slash commands |
| Honeypot feature | Exempt commands → staff repo; ban path uses `memberHasStaffRole` |

**Migration sketch:**

```sql
ALTER TABLE honeypot_exempt_roles RENAME TO staff_roles;
-- SQLite supports RENAME TABLE; app code switches queries.
```

Repository facade exports both names temporarily if needed:

- `addStaffRole` / `listStaffRoles` / `memberHasStaffRole` (canonical)
- `addHoneypotExemptRole` = alias of `addStaffRole` during transition

---

### 4.7 Implementation order

1. Migration rename `honeypot_exempt_roles` → `staff_roles`; move repo to `staffRoles.js`; honeypot imports staff helpers  
2. Upgrade `permissions.js` (`isStaff` / `requireStaff`); swap call sites  
3. `/staff role add|remove|list` + `/staff settings`  
4. Alias or rewire `/honeypot exempt *` to the same store; update honeypot docs  
5. Adjust `defaultMemberPermissions` strategy (prefer option A)  
6. Tests: ManageGuild passes; staff role passes; neither fails; honeypot exempt still works after rename; empty list = ManageGuild-only for gate  

---

### 4.8 Design decisions (locked)

| # | Decision |
|---|----------|
| 1 | **Single table:** generalize `honeypot_exempt_roles` → `staff_roles`; no per-feature access-role tables. |
| 2 | **Admin gate:** ManageGuild **or** any staff role for staff/config commands. |
| 3 | **Only ManageGuild** may add/remove staff roles. |
| 4 | **Honeypot exemption** = staff role membership only (not bare ManageGuild) — keep current honeypot safety. |
| 5 | **Tickets / notes / warnings** consume this module; they do not define their own staff role lists. |
| 6 | **Empty list:** command gate = ManageGuild only; honeypot bans anyone without a listed role. |
| 7 | **Modular:** one permissions + repository module; features call `requireStaff` / `listStaffRoles` only. |

**Still open (non-blocking):**

- Keep `/honeypot exempt` as permanent alias vs deprecate after one release.  
- Whether event-reminder **guild** defaults require staff gate vs ManageGuild-only.  
- Optional future **capabilities** (e.g. role may warn but not edit honeypot) — **out of MVP**; all staff roles are full admin-gate equivalents.

---

## 5. Staff Notes System

### Purpose

Private, staff-only notes about a guild member. Informal institutional memory for moderators—context that is **not** a formal disciplinary action and is **never** shown to the member.

Paired with the [Warning System](#6-warning-system): notes hold soft context; warnings are the **permanent formal record**.

**Access:** [guild staff roles / admin gate](#4-guild-staff-roles-admin-gate) — not a notes-specific role list.

### Status

**Shipped** — `/note` commands, soft-delete, sequential `note_number`, audit embeds, content modals, ticket-close attach. Access uses `requireStaff` ([§4 staff roles](#4-guild-staff-roles-admin-gate)). Design decisions in [5.6](#56-design-decisions-locked).

---

### 5.1 Core behavior

```
Staff adds a note on a user
        → requireStaff (ManageGuild or staff role)
        → store in SQLite (guild-scoped)
        → staff can list / edit / soft-delete notes for that user
        → member never sees notes via bot commands or DMs
        → optional staff log channel embed on create/edit/delete
```

| Rule | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Audience | **Staff gate** only ([§4](#4-guild-staff-roles-admin-gate)) |
| Visibility | Never DM’d; never exposed on member-facing commands |
| Mutability | Editable and soft-deletable (unlike warnings) |
| Scope | Per guild + user |
| Purpose | Context, history, “watch for X”, prior conversations—not a strike count |

---

### 5.2 Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/note add user:<member> [content:<text>]` | Create a staff note (omit content → modal for long text) |
| `/note list user:<member>` | List notes for a member (newest first; paginate if many) |
| `/note edit id:<note_id> content:<text>` | Replace note body; record `edited_at` / `edited_by` |
| `/note delete id:<note_id>` | Soft-delete (`deleted_at`); keep row for audit |
| `/note info id:<note_id>` | Single note detail (author, timestamps, body) |
| `/note settings` | Brief status; points at `/staff role list` for access |

**Permission:** `requireStaff` for all note commands (no separate `/note role *`).

**UX notes:**
- Prefer a **modal** for long `content` (omit slash `content` on add/edit).
- Ephemeral replies for all note commands.
- List embeds: note id, snippet, author, relative time; deleted notes only if “include deleted” (default: active only).
- **Ticket close:** `/ticket close staff_note:…` and/or **Add staff note** button → modal.

---

### 5.3 Database schema (working draft)

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS staff_notes (
    id           INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    guild_id     TEXT NOT NULL,
    note_number  INTEGER NOT NULL,          -- sequential per guild (N-12)
    user_id      TEXT NOT NULL,            -- subject
    author_id    TEXT NOT NULL,            -- staff who created
    content      TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at   INTEGER NOT NULL,
    edited_at    INTEGER,
    edited_by    TEXT,
    deleted_at   INTEGER,                  -- soft delete; null = active
    deleted_by   TEXT,
    UNIQUE (guild_id, note_number)
);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_staff_notes_user
  ON staff_notes(guild_id, user_id, created_at DESC);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_staff_notes_active
  ON staff_notes(guild_id, user_id) WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;
```

**Repositories / db facade (sketch):**

- `createStaffNote({ guildId, userId, authorId, content })`
- `listStaffNotes(guildId, userId, { includeDeleted })`
- `getStaffNote(guildId, noteNumberOrId)`
- `updateStaffNote(id, { content, editedBy })`
- `softDeleteStaffNote(id, deletedBy)`

Access checks live in `permissions.js` / staff roles — **not** a notes access-role table.

---

### 5.4 Integration points

| Area | Change |
|------|--------|
| `src/features/staffNotes/` | Feature module (commands + handlers) |
| `src/commands/` registry | Register `/note` subcommands |
| `src/db/` | Migration + repository + facade |
| `src/core/permissions.js` | `requireStaff` on every handler |
| Audit / staff log | Optional embeds on create/edit/delete when audit log channel is set |
| Docs | `docs/staff-notes.md` |

---

### 5.5 Implementation order

1. Depends on §4 staff roles / `requireStaff`  
2. Migration + repository  
3. `/note add` + `/note list`  
4. `/note edit` + `/note delete` + `/note info` + `/note settings`  
5. Optional audit embeds  
6. Docs + tests (CRUD, soft-delete, staff role vs outsider, ManageGuild)

---

### 5.6 Design decisions (locked)

| # | Decision |
|---|----------|
| 1 | **Staff-only:** notes never DMed or shown to the subject member. |
| 2 | **Soft-delete only** in MVP; hard delete not exposed. |
| 3 | **Editable** — notes are working memory, not a legal-style record. |
| 4 | **Separate from warnings** — no automatic promotion of notes into warnings. |
| 5 | **Access via guild staff roles** ([§4](#4-guild-staff-roles-admin-gate)) — no `staff_note_access_roles` table. |
| 6 | **Per-guild sequential `note_number`** for human-friendly refs (`N-12`). |

**Still open (non-blocking):**

- Whether `/note list` without a user lists recent guild-wide notes (recommend **yes**, capped, staff-only).  
- Max content length (recommend **2000** chars).

---

## 6. Warning System

### Purpose

Formal, **permanent** disciplinary record for guild members. Complements [staff notes](#5-staff-notes-system): notes are private working memory; warnings are countable, auditable strikes that staff and (optionally) the member can see. Built for long-term history—voidable with a paper trail, **not** casually deleted.

**Staff ops access:** same [guild staff roles / admin gate](#4-guild-staff-roles-admin-gate).

### Status

**Shipped (MVP + post-MVP polish)** — `/warn` + `/setwarn`, permanent rows, void with reason, member `/warn mine`, optional note link, DMs + audit embeds, opt-in expiry, staff export, evidence fields. Design decisions in [6.9](#69-design-decisions-locked). Auto-mod thresholds remain post-MVP.

---

### 6.1 Notes vs warnings (product contract)

| | Staff notes | Warnings |
|--|-------------|----------|
| Intent | Informal context | Formal disciplinary action |
| Member visibility | Never | Active warnings listable by subject; optional DM on issue |
| Mutability | Edit + soft-delete | **No edit of reason** after issue; **void** only (keeps row) |
| Counting | Not counted | Active count drives history / future auto-mod |
| Permanence | Soft-deleted notes hidden by default | **Permanent record** — voided still appears in full history |
| Human id | `N-{n}` | `W-{n}` |
| Staff access | Guild staff roles (§4) | Guild staff roles (§4) |

Staff should use **notes** for soft context and **warnings** when the action is on the record.

---

### 6.2 Core behavior

```
Staff issues /warn add @user reason
        → requireStaff
        → allocate sequential warning_number (W-n)
        → persist row (active; never hard-deleted by bot commands)
        → optional DM to member (guild setting; default ON)
        → optional embed to audit / warn-log channel
        → ephemeral confirm to staff with active count

Staff voids /warn void id reason
        → set voided_at / voided_by / void_reason
        → row remains queryable forever as voided
        → optional DM + staff log “warning voided”

Staff / member lists history
        → active by default; full history includes voided
```

| Rule | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Permanence | No hard-delete command. Void = soft cancel with reason. |
| Reason | **Required** on issue and on void |
| Scope | Per guild + user |
| Active count | `COUNT(*) WHERE voided_at IS NULL` for that guild/user |
| Self-service | Members may view **their own** warnings (`/warn mine`) without staff role |
| Staff access | `requireStaff` ([§4](#4-guild-staff-roles-admin-gate)) |
| Escalation | Threshold auto-kick/ban = **post-MVP** |

---

### 6.3 Commands

#### Staff ops (`requireStaff`)

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/warn add user:<member> reason:<text> [silent:<bool>]` | Issue a warning. `silent` skips member DM for this issue only. |
| `/warn list user:<member> [include_voided:<bool>]` | History for a member (default active only) |
| `/warn info id:<warning_id\|W-n>` | Full detail: reason, issuer, timestamps, void metadata |
| `/warn void id:<…> reason:<text>` | Void a warning (permanent row; marks inactive) |
| `/warn count user:<member>` | Active warning count (+ optional recent snippet) |
| `/warn settings` | DM flag, log target; points at `/staff role list` for access |

#### Config (ManageGuild only — same meta-privilege as staff role config)

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/setwarn dm <true\|false>` | Toggle member DMs on issue/void (default true) |

#### Everyone

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/warn mine [include_voided:<bool>]` | View your own warnings in this guild (ephemeral) |

Ephemeral replies for all `/warn` commands (staff logs are separate channel posts).

**Reason length:** non-empty trimmed text; max **1000** chars (MVP). Longer narratives belong in a linked staff note.

---

### 6.4 Member notification & staff log

#### DM to member (default on)

When a warning is issued and DMs are open:

- Embed title: `Warning issued in {guild name}`
- Fields: warning id (`W-n`), reason, issuer (display name), active count after issue, timestamp
- Footer: how to view history (`/warn mine`)

On void (if DM on): short notice that `W-n` was voided and by whom (optional reason).

Guild setting `warn_dm_members` (default **1**). Per-issue `silent:true` overrides DM off for that issue only (staff still get confirm).

#### Staff / audit channel

When dedicated `warn_log_channel_id` is set **or** `audit_log_channel_id` is set (fallback):

| Event | Embed |
|-------|--------|
| Warning issued | Target, issuer, `W-n`, reason, new active count |
| Warning voided | Target, voider, `W-n`, void reason, remaining active count |

**Shipped:** prefer `warn_log_channel_id` (`/setwarn log`); fall back to **audit log** when dedicated channel is unset.

---

### 6.5 Configuration

| Setting / command | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| Guild staff roles | Access control via [§4](#4-guild-staff-roles-admin-gate) (`/staff role *`) |
| `/warn settings` | DM flag, log target |
| `/setwarn dm <true\|false>` | Toggle member DMs (ManageGuild) |
| `/setwarn log channel\|clear` | Dedicated warn log channel (ManageGuild); falls back to audit |

**Stored in `guild_settings`:**

| Column | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `warn_dm_members` | `1` (default) / `0` — DM subject on issue/void |
| `warn_log_channel_id` | Optional dedicated issue/void log channel (**shipped**) |

**Later:** auto-mod thresholds, warn-expiry timers.

---

### 6.6 Database schema (working draft)

```sql
-- guild_settings.warn_dm_members INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1
-- Access roles: staff_roles (see §4) — no warn_access_roles table

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS warnings (
    id              INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    guild_id        TEXT NOT NULL,
    warning_number  INTEGER NOT NULL,       -- sequential per guild (W-12)
    user_id         TEXT NOT NULL,         -- subject
    issuer_id       TEXT NOT NULL,         -- staff who issued
    reason          TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at      INTEGER NOT NULL,
    voided_at       INTEGER,
    voided_by       TEXT,
    void_reason     TEXT,
    related_note_id INTEGER REFERENCES staff_notes(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
    UNIQUE (guild_id, warning_number)
);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_warnings_user
  ON warnings(guild_id, user_id, created_at DESC);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_warnings_active
  ON warnings(guild_id, user_id) WHERE voided_at IS NULL;
```

**Repositories / db facade (sketch):**

- `createWarning({ guildId, userId, issuerId, reason, relatedNoteId? })`
- `listWarnings(guildId, userId, { includeVoided })`
- `getWarning(guildId, warningNumberOrId)`
- `voidWarning(id, { voidedBy, voidReason })`
- `countActiveWarnings(guildId, userId)`
- `updateGuildSettings` key `warn_dm_members`

**Integrity rules:**

- `void` requires non-empty `void_reason`.
- Cannot “un-void” in MVP (re-issue if needed).
- `related_note_id` is optional; soft-deleting a note does not remove the warning.

---

### 6.7 Integration points

| Area | Change |
|------|--------|
| `src/features/warnings/` | Feature module (commands + DM/log helpers) |
| `src/commands/` registry | Register `/warn`, `/setwarn` |
| `src/db/` | Migration + repository + facade; optional FK to `staff_notes` |
| `src/core/permissions.js` | `requireStaff` on staff ops; `/warn mine` public |
| `src/features/logs/` / audit | Issue/void embeds on audit channel |
| Command channels | Honor existing allow-list for slash commands |
| Docs | `docs/warnings.md` (cross-link staff notes + staff roles) |

**Bot permissions:** Send Messages + Embed Links in audit channel; DM failure does not roll back the warning.

---

### 6.8 Implementation order

1. Depends on §4 `requireStaff`  
2. Migration + repository (`warnings` + `warn_dm_members`)  
3. `/warn add` + `/warn list` + `/warn count` + `/warn info`  
4. `/warn void`  
5. `/warn mine` (no staff role required)  
6. DM + audit embeds; `/setwarn dm` + `/warn settings`  
7. Optional `related_note_id` once staff notes exist  
8. Docs + tests: issue, void, count, DM-off, staff role / outsider, permanence  

---

### 6.9 Design decisions (locked)

| # | Decision |
|---|----------|
| 1 | **Permanent record:** never hard-delete via bot commands; **void** only, with reason and actor. |
| 2 | **Reason immutable** after issue — void + re-issue, not silent edit. |
| 3 | **Complement to staff notes:** informal context in notes; formal strikes in warnings. |
| 4 | **DM members by default**; guild toggle + per-issue `silent`. DM failure does not roll back. |
| 5 | **Member self-view** via `/warn mine` (no staff role required). |
| 6 | **Access via guild staff roles** ([§4](#4-guild-staff-roles-admin-gate)) — no `warn_access_roles` table. |
| 7 | **`/setwarn dm`:** ManageGuild only (meta config). |
| 8 | **Human ids** sequential per guild (`W-n`); stable forever including after void. |
| 9 | **No auto-mod escalation in MVP**. |
| 10 | **Audit stream:** reuse `audit_log_channel_id` when set. |

**Still open (non-blocking):**

- Whether void DMs use the same toggle as issue DMs (recommend **yes**).  
- Cross-link UX: `/warn add` optional `note:` from staff notes.  
- Export / prune policy for left members (recommend **keep forever**).

## 7. Database Migration Summary

### Guild staff roles (admin gate)

| Table / change | Notes |
|----------------|-------|
| `honeypot_exempt_roles` → `staff_roles` | Rename only; same columns (`guild_id`, `role_id`, `created_at`, PK). Existing exempt rows become staff roles. |
| — | No per-feature access-role tables for notes/warns/tickets |

### Tickets

| Table / change | Notes |
|----------------|-------|
| `tickets` | Lifecycle, sensitive flag, UUID transcript token, `archived` |
| `ticket_members` | Extra member participants |
| `ticket_staff` | Named staff allow-list on a ticket (sensitive / extras) — **not** the guild staff role list |
| `ticket_messages` | Only for fully archived (non-sensitive) tickets |
| `guild_settings.ticket_*` | category, archive channel, rate limit (**no** `ticket_staff_role`) |

### Event reminders

| Table / change | Notes |
|----------------|-------|
| `event_reminder_configs` | Event ↔ role ↔ channel ↔ template (**shipped**, migration `006`) |
| `event_reminder_event_optouts` | Per-event mute (**shipped**, migration `015`) |
| `event_reminder_offsets` | Each “X before” fire + sent state (**shipped**) |
| `event_reminder_optouts` | Per-guild user opt-out (**shipped**) |
| `guild_settings.event_reminder_channel_id` | Default notify channel (**shipped**) |

### Twitch stream notifications

| Table / change | Notes |
|----------------|-------|
| `twitch_channels` | Per-guild broadcaster subscriptions + live/stream dedup state |
| `guild_settings.twitch_notification_channel_id` | Go-live Discord channel |
| `guild_settings.twitch_notify_role_id` | Optional ping role (≠ YouTube roles) |
| `guild_settings.twitch_polling_interval_minutes` | Poll interval (default 2) |

### Staff notes

| Table / change | Notes |
|----------------|-------|
| `staff_notes` | Per-guild sequential notes; soft-delete; edit metadata (**shipped**) |

### Warnings

| Table / change | Notes |
|----------------|-------|
| `warnings` | Permanent rows; void metadata; optional `related_note_id` → `staff_notes` (**shipped**, migration `009`) |
| `warnings.expires_at` / evidence columns | Opt-in expiry + staff evidence (**shipped**, migration `017`) |
| `guild_settings.warn_dm_members` | Default `1` — DM subject on issue/void (**shipped**) |
| `guild_settings.warn_log_channel_id` | Dedicated warn issue/void log; audit fallback (**shipped**) |
| `guild_settings.warn_expiry_days` | Default `0` (never); guild default for new warnings (**shipped**, migration `017`) |

**Removed from roadmap as standalone product:** Honeypot feature (implemented — see `docs/honeypot.md`). Exempt roles are **absorbed** into guild staff roles (§4).

---

## 8. Post-MVP TODOs

### XP & leaderboard polish

Docs currently describe two incomplete slash surfaces honestly; this section is the product follow-up.

#### `/setxp` — expose `level_xp_factor`

**Today:** `guild_settings.level_xp_factor` (default `100`) drives `levelFromXp` everywhere, and `/settings` shows it, but `/setxp` only accepts `message` / `reaction` / `voice` / `msgcooldown` / `reactioncooldown`. Operators must use SQL or `updateGuildSettings` to change the curve ([docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md#level-curve-configuration)).

- [ ] Add optional integer option `level_xp_factor` (or short name `factor`) on `/setxp`, min **1**, sensible max (e.g. **10000**)
- [ ] Persist via `updateGuildSettings`; include in `/setxp` audit `logConfigChange` payload
- [ ] Reply should show before/after factor and a one-line reminder of the formula (`L² × factor` XP for level L)
- [ ] Unit/integration: set factor → `/xp` level and leaderboard level labels match new curve
- [ ] Update [docs/commands](docs/commands/index.md), [configuration](docs/configuration.md), [xp-and-leveling](docs/xp-and-leveling.md), FAQ once shipped

**Out of scope:** per-user curve overrides; non-sqrt formulas.

#### `/leaderboard` — honor `limit`

**Today:** Slash defines optional `limit` (integer), but `handleLeaderboard` always calls `topUsers(guildId, 10)` and the PNG is fixed to 10 rows ([docs/leaderboard.md](docs/leaderboard.md)).

- [ ] Read `interaction.options.getInteger("limit")` with clamp (e.g. default **10**, min **1**, max **20** or **25** — match Discord option constraints)
- [ ] Pass clamped limit into `topUsers(guildId, n)`
- [ ] Resize PNG layout (`render/leaderboard.js`) for `n` rows (height / row math), or keep PNG top-10 and only expand a text summary if full canvas resize is too large a change — **prefer full PNG for `n`**
- [ ] Message content: `**Leaderboard (Top N)**` reflecting the applied limit
- [ ] Integration test: seed >10 users; `limit:15` returns 15 ranks
- [ ] Update [docs/commands](docs/commands/index.md) and [leaderboard](docs/leaderboard.md) (remove “limit unused” note)

**Out of scope:** multi-page leaderboards; ephemeral vs public toggle.

### Guild staff roles

- [ ] Optional capability flags per role (warn-only, config-only, …) — MVP is full admin-gate equivalence  
- [ ] `added_by` column on `staff_roles`  
- [ ] Audit embed when staff roles are added/removed  

### Tickets

- [x] Panel message + button → modal for ticket description  
- [ ] Login with Discord on transcript HTTP routes  
- [x] Download/mirror all attachments into transcript storage at archive time (replace hotlinks)  
- [ ] Richer `/ticket list` filters  
- [ ] Stored panel registry (list/edit/delete via commands)  

### Event reminders

- [x] Richer templates / embed reminders (always embed + placeholders `{url}` `{description}` `{offset}`)  
- [x] Per-event mute (`/mute` / `/unmute`; guild `/optout` still wins)  
- [x] Auto-suggest shortname from event title (+ collision suffix `-2`…)  

### Twitch stream notifications

- [ ] Twitch EventSub (webhook or conduit) instead of / in addition to polling  
- [ ] Per-channel Discord channel or role overrides  
- [ ] Custom go-live message templates  
- [ ] Optional go-offline message (default off)  
- [ ] Clip / VOD hooks (out of scope for stream-live MVP)  

### Staff notes

- [x] Guild-wide recent notes feed without targeting a user (`/note list` without `user`)  
- [x] Attach note from ticket close flow (`staff_note` option + **Add staff note** button → modal)  
- [x] Content modal for long notes (omit slash `content` on add/edit; max 2000)  
- [x] Wire access to full staff roles once §4 ships (`isStaff` already the call site)  

### Warnings

- [x] MVP: issue / list / info / void / count / mine + `/setwarn dm` + audit + optional note link  
- [ ] Auto-mod thresholds (e.g. 3 active → timeout / kick / ban with configurable actions)  
- [x] Dedicated `warn_log_channel_id` separate from general audit log (`/setwarn log`; falls back to audit)  
- [x] Warning expiry / auto-void after N days (opt-in; default still permanent) — guild `/setwarn expiry` + per-warn `expires_days`  
- [x] Export user record (notes + warnings) for staff handoff — `/warn export` ephemeral `.md`  
- [x] ~~Un-void / re-activate~~ — **skipped**; prefer re-issue (no un-void command)  
- [x] Evidence: message jump link + freeform staff-only notes on `/warn add` (not in member DM / `/warn mine`)
