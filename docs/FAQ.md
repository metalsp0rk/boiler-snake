# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

Common questions and answers for Boiler Snake users and administrators.

## General Questions

### Q: What is Boiler Snake?

**A**: A Discord bot that tracks user XP through messages, reactions, and voice activity, with automatic role management based on levels. It's designed to gamify your server and reward participation.

**Key Features**:
- Multi-source XP tracking (messages, reactions, voice)
- Level-based role granting
- Daily XP decay for inactive users
- YouTube notifications for streams/uploads
- Music player (`/play` in voice via Lavalink)
- Honeypot channels (auto-ban decoy-channel posters)
- Help tickets, staff notes, warnings, user activity
- Beautiful PNG leaderboards

---

### Q: How do I update the bot?

**A**: Follow these steps:

```bash
# Stop the current instance (Ctrl+C)
git pull origin main
npm install  # Install any new dependencies
npm start    # Restart the bot
```

If database migrations are included in the update:
- Bot will auto-run migrations on startup
- No manual intervention needed
- Check logs for migration messages

---

### Q: Can I use this bot across multiple servers?

**A**: Yes! Boiler Snake supports multi-guild operation. Each server has its own:

- XP data (separate user databases)
- Settings (XP rates, decay configs, etc.)
- Role mappings
- YouTube subscriptions
- Command channel restrictions
- Honeypot channels and exempt roles

Install once, add to multiple servers using the OAuth2 URL.

---

### Q: How do honeypot channels work?

**A**: Mark a decoy channel with `/honeypot channel add`. Anyone who posts there is DM'd (if possible), the message is deleted, and they are banned—unless they have a **staff role** (`staff_roles`).

**Important**:
- Exempt staff **before** enabling honeypots (`/staff role add` or `/honeypot exempt add` — same list)
- The bot needs **Ban Members** (and ideally **Manage Messages**)
- The bot’s role must be **above** members it needs to ban
- Bots are ignored; only human posters trigger bans

Full guide: [Honeypot Channels](honeypot.md). See also [Staff Roles](staff-roles.md).

## XP and Leveling Questions

### Q: My XP isn't updating. Why?

**Checklist**:

1. **Message Content Intent**: Enable in Developer Portal → Bot settings → Privileged Gateway Intents

2. **Cooldowns**: Check your cooldown settings:
   ```bash
   /settings  # View current cooldowns
   ```

3. **Test manually**: Try sending multiple messages in different channels to verify.

4. **Check logs**: Look for errors when messages are sent:
   ```
   npm start  # Watch for [MessageCreate] error messages
   ```

**Common fix**: Enable Message Content Intent in Developer Portal (required for reliable message tracking).

---

### Q: How is leveling calculated?

**A**: Using the formula:

```
Level = floor(sqrt(XP / level_xp_factor))
```

Where `level_xp_factor` defaults to 100.

**Example calculations**:
- Level 1: requires ≥ 100 XP (with factor=100)
- Level 2: requires ≥ 400 XP
- Level 3: requires ≥ 900 XP
- Level 10: requires ≥ 10,000 XP

The curve factor defaults to **100** and is stored in `guild_settings.level_xp_factor`. Change it with `/setxp factor:<int>` (range 1–10,000). See [Configuration — Level curve](configuration.md#level-curve-configuration).

---

### Q: Can I disable message XP but keep reaction/voice?

**A**: Yes! Use:

```bash
/setxp message:0
```

This sets message XP to 0 while keeping other sources active. Users will still earn from reactions and voice activity.

---

## Role Management Questions

### Q: Why isn't my bot granting roles?

**Checklist**:

1. **Bot permissions**: Verify "Manage Roles" is enabled in Discord Developer Portal → Bot permissions

2. **Role position**: In your server settings:
   - Go to Roles
   - Find your bot's role
   - Drag it ABOVE the roles you want it to manage
   
3. **Level thresholds**: Check if user has actually reached required level with `/xp [user]`

4. **View mappings**:
   ```bash
   /leveltorole list  # Verify mapping exists
   ```

---

### Q: How does the drop grace period work?

**A**: When a user drops below their role's required level:

1. Bot marks them as "below threshold" with current timestamp
2. If they return to meeting the requirement before grace ends: Timer clears, role kept
3. If grace period expires (e.g., 7 days): Role is revoked

**Example**: User at Level 10 has @Member role (requires L5). They drop to Level 4:
- Timers starts for losing @Member role
- If within 7 days they level back to 5+: Keep role
- If 7 days pass while at Level 4: Lose @Member role

---

## Decay Questions

### Q: What happens if I disable decay?

**A**: XP accumulates indefinitely. Users can become "levellocked" by early gain without maintaining activity.

**When to disable**:
- Testing the bot
- Very small servers (10-50 active members)
- Servers with special events where XP hoarding is acceptable

---

### Q: Can I adjust decay mid-week?

**A**: Yes! Decay runs daily at 4:00 AM server time. Changes take effect at the next scheduled run.

**Example**: If you change settings at 3:00 PM Tuesday, new settings apply Thursday at 4:00 AM (when Wednesday's decay runs).

---

### Q: Do I have to wait until 4 AM for decay to take effect?

**A**: Not if you're testing! You can manually trigger by updating XP in the database:

```sql
-- Get current XP
SELECT xp FROM users WHERE guild_id='...' AND user_id='...';

-- Manually reduce (simulating decay)
UPDATE users SET xp=500 WHERE guild_id='...' AND user_id='...';
```

**Note**: This bypasses the normal activity check—only use for testing.

---

## YouTube Notifications Questions

### Q: Where do I get a YouTube API key?

**A**: Follow these steps:

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project
3. Navigate to APIs & Services → Library
4. Search "YouTube Data API v3" and click Enable
5. Go to Credentials → Create credentials → API key
6. Copy the key to your `.env` file as `YOUTUBE_API_KEY`

---

### Q: The bot can't find my subscribed channel

**A**: Common causes:

1. **@username not resolved yet**: First subscription may take time to resolve @username to numeric ID
2. **Channel doesn't exist**: Double-check the URL
3. **API limit exceeded**: Wait 24 hours for quota reset or reduce polling interval

---

### Q: Can I get notifications only for live streams (no videos)?

**A**: Not directly—YouTube Data API v3 fetches both. However, you can:

1. Subscribe via `/youtube add`
2. The bot posts both types of alerts
3. Have moderators manually ignore video-only updates
4. Future feature: Filter by type (planned)

---

## Leaderboard Questions

### Q: Why do I see "tofu blocks" instead of emoji?

**A**: Missing Unicode fonts on your host system.

**Fix (Ubuntu/Debian)**:
```bash
sudo apt install fonts-noto-core fonts-dejavu-core fonts-noto-color-emoji
```

**Alternative (Alpine)**:
```bash
sudo apk add noto-fonts ttf-dejavu
```

---

### Q: Can I customize the leaderboard appearance?

**A**: Yes — edit the canonical renderer **`src/render/leaderboard.js`**.  
(`src/renderLeaderboard.js` is only a deprecated compat shim that re-exports that module.)

```javascript
// Background colors
const bg0 = "#070A12";  // Change hex values
const bg1 = "#0B1224";

// Row dimensions
const rowStep = 70;     // Increase for more spacing

// Font stack near the top of the file
const FONT_STACK = [
  '"Noto Sans"',
  // Add custom fonts here
].join(", ");
```

See [Leaderboard Rendering](leaderboard.md).

---

## Staff, Permissions & Deploy

### Q: Staff commands say I don't have permission. Why?

**A**: Most staff/config features use **`requireStaff`**: you need **Manage Server** **or** any role registered with `/staff role add` (junior or senior).

- Manage Server–only examples: staff-role edits (`/staff role add|remove|setlevel`), `/staff syncpermissions`, `/setcommandchannel`, `/honeypot exempt`
- Public examples: `/xp`, `/leaderboard`, `/warn mine`, `/ticket create`

Configure roles: `/staff role add role:@Mod level:senior` (or `junior`).  
Guide: [Staff Roles](staff-roles.md).

### Q: Staff have the role but can't see slash commands in `/`

**A**: Discord’s command picker is separate from bot handler checks. Staff-tier commands default to **Manage Server** visibility. An admin should run **`/staff syncpermissions`** (OAuth once per guild) so each `staff_roles` role is allowed in Discord. Operators need `CLIENT_SECRET` + a public HTTP URL (same host as ticket transcripts is fine). Details: [Command visibility sync](staff-roles.md#command-visibility-sync-optional).

---

### Q: Junior staff can't see ticket channels

**A**: Ticket **channel overwrites** are granted to **senior** staff roles only. Junior staff can still run many ticket **commands**, but they do not automatically get View Channel on every ticket.

Fix: `/staff role setlevel role:@Helper level:senior`, or add the junior member with `/ticket addstaff` for that ticket.

Guide: [Help Tickets](tickets.md).

---

### Q: Tickets fail with Missing Permissions (50013)

**A**: Usually Discord hierarchy:

1. Bot needs **Manage Channels**
2. **Bot role must be above** every senior staff role it applies overwrites for
3. Restart / re-check overwrites after role order changes

Guide: [Help Tickets](tickets.md).

---

### Q: After deploy, slash commands are missing or outdated

**A**: Registration is separate from starting the bot:

```bash
npm run register
# Docker:
docker compose run --rm bot node src/commands/register.js
```

- **Global** commands can take minutes to hours to appear
- Set `DEV_GUILD_ID` for instant guild-scoped registration while developing
- Then restart the bot process

---

### Q: Where are warnings, notes, events, and activity docs?

**A**:

| Feature | Doc |
|---------|-----|
| Staff roles | [staff-roles.md](staff-roles.md) |
| Help tickets | [tickets.md](tickets.md) |
| Warnings | [warnings.md](warnings.md) |
| Staff notes | [staff-notes.md](staff-notes.md) |
| Event reminders | [event-reminders.md](event-reminders.md) |
| User activity | [user-activity.md](user-activity.md) |

---

## Technical Questions

### Q: Where is my data stored?

**A**: All data is in a SQLite database file:
```
boiler-snake/xpbot.sqlite
```

This single file contains:
- User XP totals
- Activity logs
- Settings per guild
- Role mappings
- YouTube subscriptions
- Command restrictions

---

### Q: How do I back up my bot's data?

**A**: Simple backup for SQLite:

```bash
# Stop the bot first
npm stop  # or Ctrl+C

# Copy database file
cp xpbot.sqlite xpbot.backup.$(date +%Y%m%d).sqlite

# Resume
npm start
```

For automated backup (Linux cron):
```bash
crontab -e

# Add: daily at midnight
0 0 * * * cp /path/to/xpbot.sqlite /backup/xpbot-$(date +\%Y\%m\%d).sqlite
```

---

### Q: Can I run multiple instances of the bot?

**A**: No—each instance needs exclusive access to `xpbot.sqlite`. SQLite doesn't support multiple writers.

**Alternatives**:
- Use one bot instance with multiple servers (supported natively)
- Deploy separate Boiler Snake installations in different directories with separate `.env` and database files

---

## Performance Questions

### Q: My bot is laggy on a large server. What can I do?

**Optimizations**:

1. **Disable decay**: 
   ```bash
   /setdecay enabled:false
   ```

2. **Reduce polling frequency** (if using YouTube):
   ```bash
   /setyoutube interval 30  # Check every 30 minutes instead of 5
   ```

3. **Clean up old activity logs**:
   ```sql
   DELETE FROM activity_log WHERE created_at < (strftime('%s','now') - 86400*90) * 1000;
   ```

---

### Q: The music bot joins voice but I hear nothing.

**A**: Discord requires DAVE (E2EE voice). Lavalink **4.2.2+** is required. Recreate the sidecar (`docker compose up -d --force-recreate lavalink`), confirm the bot has **Speak**, and check logs for `[music] Lavalink node connected`. See [Music player](music.md#joined-but-no-audio).

Spotify cannot stream full tracks; links resolve via YouTube Music. Wrong matches and YouTube 403s are Lavalink plugin issues — bump the YouTube plugin in `application.yml`.

---

### Q: How much memory does the bot use?

**Approximate baseline** (no decay):
- Bot process: 20-30 MB RAM
- Cooldown maps: <1 MB
- Voice states in cache: ~50 KB per active voice user

With daily decay:
- Activity logs grow ~100 bytes/user/day
- No automatic purge—run `VACUUM;` periodically for old servers
