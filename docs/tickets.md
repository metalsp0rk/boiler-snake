# Help Ticket System

Private per-server support tickets: members open a channel with staff, staff respond, then **non-sensitive** tickets are closed and **archived** (HTML transcript + summary in a staff channel). **Sensitive** tickets are never content-archived—closing deletes the channel and posts a metadata-only stub.

## How it works

```
Member /ticket create [reason]
   or   panel button → modal (description)
        → rate limit (default 1 self-create / 60 min)
        → channel ticket-N under configured category
        → overwrites: @everyone deny view; members + each senior staff role allow
        → welcome embed

Staff /ticket claim · adduser · sensitive · close · archive
        → close: remove non-staff members; keep channel for staff (DM requester: reason only)
        → archive: non-sensitive → fetch → HTML transcript → archive embed → DM requester transcript link → delete channel
                   sensitive → metadata stub only → delete channel (no content, no URL DM)
```

### Staff role levels (ticket visibility)

| Level | Staff commands (`requireStaff`) | Honeypot exempt | Ticket channel overwrites |
|-------|----------------------------------|-----------------|---------------------------|
| **senior** | Yes | Yes | Yes (open non-sensitive tickets) |
| **junior** | Yes | Yes | **No** — use `/ticket addstaff` or claim/transfer for named access |
| Manage Server only | Yes (commands) | No (honeypot) | No automatic overwrite |

Configure: `/staff role add role level`, `/staff role setlevel`, `/staff role list`. Full model: [Staff roles](staff-roles.md).

| Rule | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Staff access | Guild [staff roles](staff-roles.md) + Manage Server. **Ticket channel visibility** is **senior** staff roles only; junior staff pass the command gate but do not get automatic channel overwrites. |
| Rate limit | Self-create only; `/ticket for` is unlimited |
| Concurrent opens | No cap per user |
| Transcript URL | Staff archive embed **plus** a best-effort DM to the **requester** (ticket ref + close reason + `[View transcript]` link when `TICKET_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` is set) on archive. Non-sensitive only — **sensitive tickets never receive any URL**, and no one but the requester is DMed |
| Sensitive | No message fetch, no HTML, no AI; channel delete is disposal |

## Setup

1. Give the bot **Manage Channels** (and keep **Manage Roles** if you use level/reaction roles). Without Manage Channels, Discord returns `50013 Missing Permissions` on create.
2. Put the **bot role above** every staff role in Server Settings → Roles. Discord will not let the bot set overwrites for higher roles.
3. Add staff roles: `/staff role add role:<role> level:senior` so mods see ticket channels (and pass the command gate). Use `level:junior` for helpers who can run staff commands but should **not** auto-see every ticket.
4. Optional category: `/ticket setcategory` (staff). Ensure the bot is allowed to create channels under that category.
5. Archive channel (staff-only in Discord perms): `/ticket setarchive`.
6. Optional rate limit: `/ticket setratelimit` (default **60** minutes; `0` = off).
7. Optional public entry panel: `/ticket panel` (staff) — posts an embed with **Open a ticket** → modal for the description (same pipeline and rate limit as `/ticket create`).
8. Optional transcript HTTP (for clickable HTML links + staff index):

```bash
TICKET_HTTP_PORT=8080
TICKET_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://tickets.example.com
```

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `GET /t` or `/` | **Index** of content-archived tickets (ticket #, guild, closed time, subject, link) |
| `GET /t/{uuid}` | Single HTML transcript |
| `GET /t/{uuid}/assets/{file}` | Mirrored attachment / embed media for that transcript |
| `GET /t?guild=<id>` | Filter index to one guild |
| `GET /t?page=N` | Pagination (50 per page) |
| `GET /health` | Health check |

On-disk layout (under `DATA_DIR`):

```
ticket-transcripts/{guild_id}/{uuid}/index.html
ticket-transcripts/{guild_id}/{uuid}/assets/001_photo.png
```

Reverse-proxy TLS in front of the bot process. The index is **not** Discord-login-gated (MVP) — keep the host private (VPN, basic auth, firewall). Sensitive tickets never appear on the index (no content archive). Still treat the Discord archive channel as staff-only.

9. Optional AI summaries (non-sensitive closes only):

```bash
AI_API_KEY=...
AI_BASE_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1   # OpenAI-compatible
AI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
```

Without an API key, archives use a stats + close-reason fallback summary. The same AI (or fallback) powers the on-demand `/ticket summarize` command.

## Commands

### Everyone

| Command / UI | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| `/ticket create [reason]` | Open a ticket for yourself (rate-limited) |
| **Open a ticket** panel button | Opens a modal for the description, then creates a ticket (same rate limit) |
| `/ticket settings` | Show category, archive channel, rate limit, staff roles |

### Staff (`requireStaff`)

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/ticket for user [reason]` | Open a ticket for a member (not rate-limited) |
| `/ticket claim` | Become staff owner (in ticket channel) |
| `/ticket transfer staff` | Reassign staff owner |
| `/ticket adduser` / `removeuser` | Member participants |
| `/ticket addstaff` / `removestaff` | Named staff allow-list (esp. when sensitive) |
| `/ticket sensitive` | Lock-down; auto-claims if no owner |
| `/ticket unsensitive` | Restore staff-role visibility |
| `/ticket close [reason] [staff_note]` | Soft-close: remove non-staff; **keep** channel for staff. Optional private staff note on the requester; reply also has **Add staff note** → modal |
| `/ticket archive` | After close: save transcript (if not sensitive), post summary, DM the requester the transcript link (non-sensitive), **delete** channel |
| `/ticket list [user]` | Open tickets |
| `/ticket info` | Detail for the current ticket channel (open or soft-closed) |
| `/ticket summarize` | On-demand AI summary of the current ticket conversation (open or soft-closed, pre-archive). Without `AI_API_KEY` (or if the API is unreachable) it replies with a stats-only fallback and says so |

Lifecycle commands work **inside the ticket channel** even if command-channel restrictions are set.

### Config (staff gate)

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/ticket setcategory` | Parent category for new tickets |
| `/ticket setarchive` | Channel for close embeds + transcript links |
| `/ticket setratelimit` | Minutes between self-creates (`0` = off) |
| `/ticket panel [channel] [title] [description]` | Post a public **Open a ticket** panel (button → modal) |

## Ticket panel (button → modal)

1. Staff runs `/ticket panel` in (or targeting) a public channel.
2. The bot posts an embed with a persistent **Open a ticket** button.
3. Members click the button → Discord modal asks for a short description.
4. On submit, the bot runs the same self-create pipeline as `/ticket create` (rate limit, channel, overwrites, welcome embed).
5. The member gets an ephemeral link to the new ticket channel.

Panels are plain bot messages (no DB row). Delete the Discord message to remove a panel, or post another with `/ticket panel`. Re-register slash commands after deploy if `/ticket panel` is missing.

## Sensitive tickets

1. Prefer `/ticket claim`, then `/ticket sensitive` (auto-claims if needed).
2. Overwrites remove staff **roles** and allow only owner + `/ticket addstaff` users + members + bot.
3. On **archive**: metadata stub in the archive channel only; **no** transcript URL or message storage — and no transcript link is ever DMed (the requester's close DM is reason-only).

## Close vs archive

### `/ticket close` (soft-close)

1. Mark ticket `status=closed` (channel id **kept**).
2. Rewrite overwrites: staff retain access; **non-staff members lose view**.
3. Post an in-channel notice; optional DM to requester (reason only).
4. Channel stays for staff review until archive.
5. **Staff notes (optional):** pass `staff_note:` to create a private note on the requester immediately, and/or use the **Add staff note** button on the ephemeral reply (opens a modal). Note body includes ticket # and close reason; never shown to the member. See [Staff notes](staff-notes.md).

### `/ticket archive` (dispose)

Requires a **closed** ticket channel.

**Non-sensitive:**

1. Fetch channel messages (oldest → newest).
2. Resolve display names (guild nickname → global name → username) for requester, staff owner, message authors, and `<@id>` mentions in content.
3. **Download media** (attachments, embed images/thumbnails/videos, stickers) into  
   `{DATA_DIR}/ticket-transcripts/{guild_id}/{uuid}/assets/`, rewrite links to  
   `/t/{uuid}/assets/…` (served by the bot). Caps: 50 MiB/file, 100 files/ticket (env overrides below).
4. Store rows in `ticket_messages` (resolved authors, expanded mentions, local asset hrefs).
5. Write HTML under `{DATA_DIR}/ticket-transcripts/{guild_id}/{uuid}/index.html`.
6. Summarize (AI or fallback).
7. Post embed to the archive channel (summary + link if `TICKET_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` set).
8. **DM the requester** (creator only): ticket ref, close reason, and a **View transcript** link when `TICKET_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` is configured (ref + reason only otherwise). Best-effort: if the DM fails (closed DMs, blocked bot), the archive reply notes a warning — the archive itself never fails because of it.
9. Delete the live ticket channel.

Transcript people lines look like `Cool Nick (@username) · 1234567890`. Mentions in message text become `@Cool Nick` (id kept in the author meta line). Images/videos/audio render inline in the HTML when mirrored.

**Sensitive:** metadata stub only → delete channel (no fetch/HTML/AI/URL/media). The requester is **not** DMed on archive — their only notice is the close DM ("closed + reason"), which never contains a URL.

Optional env for media mirroring:

```bash
# TICKET_MAX_ASSET_BYTES=52428800   # default 50 MiB per file
# TICKET_MAX_ASSETS=100            # default max files per ticket
```

## Not in MVP

- Discord OAuth gate on `/t/{uuid}`
- Concurrent open-ticket caps
- Re-download / re-mirror media for tickets archived before local assets existed
- Stored panel registry (list/edit/delete via commands) — delete the Discord message or repost
